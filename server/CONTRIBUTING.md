# Contributing to Express API TypeScript Template

I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github

I use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Automated Checks on Pull Requests

When you submit a pull request, a GitHub workflow will automatically run, which includes Biome checks for linting and formatting errors. **Pull requests with linting or formatting errors will not be merged.** Please run `yarn lint` before pushing your changes to ensure that your contributions meet the code standards.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) that covers the project. This includes new code, files, patches, and any other modifications created or contributed by you.

I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/suparthghimire/Express-API-Typescript-Template/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.

## Main Branch is Locked

The main branch is locked, meaning direct pushes are not allowed. All changes should be made through a fork and pull request process:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your modifications.
4. **Push** your changes back to your fork.
5. Submit a **Pull Request** from your repository's branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.

This process ensures that all contributions are reviewed and tested, maintaining the quality and integrity of the codebase.
